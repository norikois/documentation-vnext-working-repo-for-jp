Once the installation is complete, you should have the following items installed in the local folder **"%public%\Documents\Infragistics\Reveal\SDK\"**:

## Adding Your License Key

By default, when you install the Reveal SDK only the **trial** product is used. In order to unlock the **licensed** product, you must provide a license key in the application.
